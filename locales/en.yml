    `/coffee` is a slash command to organize coffee runs.

      Here are the available commands:

      `/coffee run [time]`
        Start a coffee run!
        Optionally, anounce in how long you'll be leaving.
        example: /coffee run 15

      `/coffee list`
        Show the list of orders for the current run.
        example: /coffee list

      `/coffee order [item]`
        Order something from the current run.
        example: /coffee order small cappuccino

      `/coffee here`
        Let everyone know that the coffee is here!
        example: /coffee here

      `/coffee help`
        Show this help message.
        example: /coffee help

    Enjoy!
